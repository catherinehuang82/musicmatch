# MusicMatch: Using Spotify API and Machine Learning for Audio Feature Visualizations and Song Recommendations

Andrew Nickerson, Catherine Huang | December 2021

### Tl;dr
Interactive Jupyter notebooks that utilize the Spotify API and machine learning (K-means, K-nearest neighbors, PCA) to 1) visualize an inputted song’s audio features and 2) make song recommendations based off of an inputted Spotify user’s chosen playlist.

### Motivation and Goals
With over 380 million monthly active users, Spotify is the world’s largest music and media streaming service provider. We were curious about how Spotify uses technology to capture an impression of each user’s music taste, and how it generates song recommendations based on that impression. Fortunately, Spotify’s open-source [Web API](https://developer.spotify.com/) helps us get one step closer towards exploring these questions. This API allows any programmer to perform functionalities similar to what Spotify’s web and mobile applications perform every instant. One can explore metadata about songs, playlists, users, or artists (for example, a user’s top tracks, an artist’s top albums, or a song’s audio features) with the API. Given that most other companies do not make the technology behind their products open to the public, we were eager to explore Spotify’s Web API to get a sense of what lay behind the scenes of a service whose underpinnings are at the intersection of music and technology. **In this project, we set out to 1) visualize the audio features of any playlist by any user, as well as 2) generate song recommendations for that user given the playlist.**
